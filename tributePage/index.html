              <p>Stephen Gary Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. His mother, Margaret Louise Wozniak (née Kern) (1923–2014) was from Washington state, and his father, Francis Jacob "Jerry" Wozniak (1925–1994) of Michigan, was an engineer for the Lockheed Corporation. Wozniak graduated from Homestead High School in 1968, in Cupertino, California. Steve has one brother and his name is Mark Wozniak. He was a Hi-tech Executive and he lives in Menlo Park. Steve Wozniak has one sister, Leslie Wozniak. She attended Homestead High School in Cupertino. She is the grant adviser of Five Bridges Foundation which helps at-risk Youths and it is in San Francisco. She once said it was her mother who inducted activism in her and siblings.</p>

            <p>Wozniak name actually don't ring any clue in your mind but thanks to him we have a microcomputer today. His is a self-taught engineer who designed the first personal computer. </p>

            <p>"Wozniak designed Apple’s first products, the Apple I and II computers and he helped design the Macintosh — because he wanted to use them and they didn’t exist." — CNBC retrospective</p>

            <p>Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend, Bill Fernandez, introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.[10][11] Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak, a self-educated electronics engineer, started to build his original “blue boxes” that enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost.[12] Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.[10][11] Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."</p>

            <p>Jobs and Wozniak, also referred to collectively as "the two Steves", had withdrawn from Reed College and UC Berkeley respectively by 1975. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay From Satori to Silicon Valley (published 1986), cultural historian Theodore Roszak made the point that Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast counterculture and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models.</p>

            <p>In 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club.[14] New microcomputers such as the Altair 8800 and the IMSAI inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal and have a complete computer. At the time the only microcomputer CPUs generally available were the $179 Intel 8080 (equivalent to $861 in 2020), and the $170 Motorola 6800 (equivalent to $818 in 2020). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU</p>

            <p>When MOS Technology released its $20 (equivalent to $91 in 2020) 6502 chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip.</p>

            <p>By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a Homebrew Computer Club meeting to show it off.[15] When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which would later become known as the Apple I, he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.[16] Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer.[17] Wozniak also originally offered the design to Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by the company on five occasions.[18] Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.[19] In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Type 2 minibus for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 programmable calculator for $500</p>

              <li>In 1979, Wozniak was awarded the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award. In 1985, both he and Steve Jobs received the National Medal of Technology from US President Ronald Reagan.</li>
              <li>In September 2000, Wozniak was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and in 2001 he was awarded the 7th Annual Heinz Award for Technology, the Economy and Employment.</li>
              <li>The American Humanist Association awarded him the Isaac Asimov Science Award in 2011.</li>
              <li>In November 2014, Industry Week added Wozniak to the Manufacturing Hall of Fame.</li>
              <li>On June 19, 2015, Wozniak received the Legacy for Children Award from the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose. The Legacy for Children Award honors an individual whose legacy has significantly benefited the learning and lives of children. The purpose of the Award is to focus Silicon Valley's attention on the needs of our children, encouraging us all to take responsibility for their well-being. Candidates are nominated by a committee of notable community members involved in children's education, health care, human and social services, and the arts. The city of San Jose named a street "Woz Way" in his honor. The street address of the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose is 180 Woz Way.</li>
              <li>On June 20, 2015, The Cal Alumni Association (UC Berkeley's Alumni Association) presented Wozniak with the 2015 Alumnus of the Year Award. "We are honored to recognize Steve Wozniak with CAA’s most esteemed award," said CAA President Cynthia So Schroeder '91. "His invaluable contributions to education and to UC Berkeley place him among Cal's most accomplished and respected alumni</li>
              <li>In March 2016, High Point University announced that Wozniak will serve as their Innovator in Residence. Wozniak was High Point University's commencement speaker in 2013. Through this ongoing partnership, Wozniak will connect with High Point University students on a variety of topics and make campus-visits periodically</li>
              <li>In March 2017, Wozniak was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 18 on its list of the 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs</li>
              <li>Wozniak is the 2021 recipient of the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award "for pioneering the design of consumer-friendly personal computers</li>
